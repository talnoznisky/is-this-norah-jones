a fog of seagulls
when the beachgoers go home
having filled dumpsters


a fresh mined bitcoin;
a full or nearly full moon:
you can't keep either


stepping off the curb
this man set his foot awrong,
fell chuckling


a mini-arÃªte
that spans two mini-mountains
rising around ponds


cold gray waves break
into airborne foam fingers
signaling, 'check please' 


left wrist wears a watch
right hand carries a coffee:
an adult is born.


a ghost in a trashbag,
see-through as city darkness,
louder than linen


hours of cool rain
shade the sandy brick and turn
september to fall


french-flag blue harbor
but the rutilant dusk bids:
adieu le bleuex


the moon escapes
Chicago's spike-tooth skyline
but can't stay away


asking for my cat:
are my cat's teeth poisonous?
and can I eat them?


the macaque hiding,
protecting the six banh mis 
he stole yesterday


Tell my wife and kids:
I left my heart in Farmville
but I won't be long


the bubble tea shop
its expansive menu paused
until tomorrow


late on a sunday
when there was little to do,
I skipped most of it.


picked wild flowers.
forgot: spiders live on them
now: they live with me. 


light rain on the way
to the late night CVS
for some tea biscuits


the storm will be past
when the rain stops beating on
my air conditioner 


the sallow moonlight
the frosting glaze of night fog
the summer, dried up


on this yom kippur
I cooked cod steaks in butter
with flash-fried dry sage


Who is this, I asked,
of the cashier at Walgreens.
Is this Norah Jones?


Sunday 
after lunch writing 
overdue emails


I spilled something.
I don't know what it was
Now it's sticky.
